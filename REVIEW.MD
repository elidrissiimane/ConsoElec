# Project Main idea
Based on the composition of food, the project depicts countries' behaviour. 
# Visualization method
there are 3 parts:
- First part :designed for displaying country ranking.
- Second  part: designed for caomparing 2 countries with a scatterplot and a spider chart.
- Third part: a word map showing countries whih helps the user to select 2 coutries to compare.
# How it works?
Basically,it's possible to chose countris on the displaying list by ticking boxes. Then, both of scatter plot and spider chart appear.
